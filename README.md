# Crow Rest API Todo List

Hello. This is a very early introduction to project that I am working on. 
The purpose of this project is use the CROW c++ framework to create a working REST API. Which I did 

## Structure

In this project, I'm currently limited on how I can deploy. This uses a local postgresSQL table to hold the tasks.
Future introduction will be a dedicated user table equipped with proper password hashing. But that's still far out. 

This code is by no means proper nor well done. Some areas lack critical functions and of are poor quality. I will be working on this from time to time. 

## Features

As of now, it features options to display all tasks, find a certain task, create, update, and delete a task which makes this a CRUD application. 

## Future Features

Before the my fall semester starts, I would love to implement:

- [ ] User sign up/login in (which retains their data using cookies or jwt's)
- [ ] Add tags
- [ ] Add time stamps when it was created/updated
- [ ] Add set/have due dates
